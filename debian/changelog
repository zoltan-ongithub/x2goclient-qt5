  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.0):
    - Windows: Fix not being able to add the server to the known_hosts file when
      the username has non-English characters. (Fixes: #566)
      (NOTE: This fix only works when the non-English characters are in the same
      language as the Windows "system locale" AKA "Language for non-Unicode
      programs." Bug #611 was written for fixing the issue for languages other
      than the system locale.)
    - Windows: Install VcXsrv "misc" fonts by default, and make all 4 font
      groups optional: misc, 75dpi, 100dpi and others (Fixes: #108)
      Note: The fact that all the fonts are included makes the installer about
      30MB larger.
    - Windows: Bundle new version of VcXsrv: 1.15.2.0-xp+vc2013+x2go1
      This new version is based on upstream VcXsrv 1.15.2.0, but still
      compatible with Windows XP. It is compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2013
      and contains 1 X2Go-specific change, winmultiwindow.patch. This patch
      fixes an issue when resizing the NX-proxy window on specific multiple
      monitor setups. (Thanks Oleksandr Shneyder for the patch)
      (Fixes: #568) (Fixes: #594)
    - Windows: Port from MinGW 4.4 + Qt 4.8.5 to MinGW 4.8.2 + Qt 4.8.6,
      including fix for QTBUG-38706 (Fixes: #474, #603)
    - Windows: Fix missing VcXsrv/zlib1.dll . The impact of this bug was that
      VcXsrv would not start if the cwd was changed from the x2goclient
      directory. (The start menu and desktop shortcuts do have the x2goclient
      directory as the cwd. So they were not affected.) (Fixes: #587)
    - Windows: Make the desktop shortcut optional during install,
      but still the default.
    - Windows: Upgrade libssh from 0.5.5 to 0.6.3. This fixes connecting to
      hpn-enabled SSH servers. The Pageant support patch from the KDE Windows
      project was ported to 0.6.3 by myself and Mike Frederick.
      (Gmail: psududemike) (Fixes: #590)
    - Windows: Win32 OpenSSL updated from 1.0.1h to 1.0.1i, which fixes the
      9 CVEs announced on 2014-08-06.
    - Windows: cygwin packages (inluding patched OpenSSH 6.6.1p1-3) updated from
      latest versions as of 2014-06-09 to latest versions as of 2014-09-16. This
      includes openssl 1.0.1i-1, which fixes the 9 CVEs announced on 2014-08-06.
      (Cygwin openssl was also individually updated to 1.0.1i-1 in
      4.0.2.1+hotfix1+build2.)
    - Windows: Build nxproxy.exe with Cygwin's libpng 1.5.x rather than 1.2.x.
      (This may improve performance when PNG compression is selected.)
    - Windows: Build cygwin openssh without krb5 or tcp_wrappers support because
      X2Go Client for Windows does not use either feature.
      (On Windows, Kerberos 5 (GSSAPI) support is provided by PuTTY.)
    - Windows: Fix text not being rendered properly at end of NSIS installer
      (Fixes: #597)

    - Only show session name in notification bubbles with debugging
      enabled. (Fixes: #364).
    - New command line option (--keep-trayicon). With that options set,
      we force X2Go client to only use the default "accelerated X" as
      system tray icon (and prohibit usage of the session's icon as
      tray icon). (Fixes: #365).
    - Provide more meaningful messages on SSH errors (host pub key not
      found, export pub key not found, authorized_keys file not found).

    - Update COPYING file (to update FSF address).
  * debian/control:
    + Add dbg:package x2goplugin-dbg.

  [ Clemens Lang ]

      that requires pulse support.
    - Check if sound is activated before starting pulse. 
    - Fix starting sshd on Win XP. (Fixes: #421).
    - Fix "fullscreen" mode on Windows 7 with multiple monitors.

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.2.1):

      PulseAudio's CPU priority from "high" to "normal" on XP specifically.

    - Windows: Enable PulseAudio log when --debug is passed.
    - Windows: Fix compatibility with current PulseAudio master branch
    - Windows: cygwin packages (inluding patched OpenSSH 6.6.1p1-3) updated from
      latest versions as of 2014-04-08 to latest versions as of 2014-06-09. This
      includes openssl 1.0.1h-1, which fixes the 6 CVEs announced on 2014-06-05.
      (Cygwin openssl was also individually updated to 1.0.1h-1 in
      4.0.2.0+build4.) This also includes migrating from libjpeg to
      libjpeg-turbo, which reduces CPU usage of nxproxy.)
    - Windows: Download and compile nx-libs-lite from the release tarball,
      rather than from git, so that the patches are actually applied
    - Windows: nx-libs-lite updated from 3.5.0.22 to 3.5.0.27
      (linked against aforementioned cygwin package versions)
    - Windows: Win32 OpenSSL updated from 1.0.1g to 1.0.1h, which fixes the 6
      CVEs announced on 2014-06-05.
      (Win32 OpenSSL was also updated to 1.0.1h in 4.0.2.0+build3.)
    - Windows: VcXsrv (XP Compatible) updated from 1.14.3.1 to 1.14.3.2.
      Fixes CVE-2014-0209, CVE-2014-0210, and CVE-2014-0211 
      (VcXsrv was also updated to 1.14.3.2 in 4.0.2.0+build2.)
    - Windows: Switch from regular NSIS 2.46 to Unicode NSIS 2.46.5
      (Fixes: #528)
