x2goclient (4.0.5.3-0x2go1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.3):
    - src/sessionbutton.cpp: replace drop down menu button on session buttons
      with a more prominent, bigger settings gear icon. Requested for
      visibility.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add debug statements to createRSAKey () regarding
      the host pub key locations on OS X.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix error message string in
      printSshDError_noHostPubKey ().
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: add SecurID prompt to challenge auth code
      prompts.
    - src/sharewidget.cpp: fix compile on UNIX-like platforms by defaulting to
      ISO-8859-1 not just on Linux but also other platforms. Fixes: #1124.
    - src/x2goutils.cpp: don't try to wrap absolute paths as legacy resource
      URIs in wrap_legacy_resource_URIs (). Fixes: #910.
    - {res/img/svg/,res/resources.qrc}: add new file hamburger.svg, a
      custom-created hamburger icon.
    - src/sessionbutton.cpp: replace drop down menu button on session buttons
      again with the custom-created hamburger icon. Also fix positioning
      issues in mini mode.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: add new function images_resource_path (),
      similar to iconsPath () but without explicitly referring to icons.
    - src/sessionbutton.cpp: we cannot use ".." in resource paths to move up
      one level, so use images_resource_path () instead and hope that we
      finally get a yummy hamburger.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: let iconsPath () take a const-reference
      instead of an object and make it a const member function.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: let images_resource_path () take a new,
      optional "base" parameter, that might be empty and is put in-between the
      fixed resource path string and the filename parameter.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: use images_resource_path () in iconsPath ().
    - src/sessionbutton.cpp: instead of using the hamburger.svg file directly,
      render it to a raster image and use this Pixmap as the icon file -
      otherwise the icon will not show up. Also change the icon size back to
      16x16 px, that's big enough.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: remove left-over debug test message.
    - {unixhelper.{cpp,h},x2goclient.pro{,.maemo}}: add unixhelper stub.
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: implement cleanup program for process group.
    - x2goclient.cpp: wrap X2Go Client main function and use that.
    - x2goclient.cpp: add fork_helper() function to start up the UNIX cleanup
      helper.
    - x2goclient.cpp: use setsid() on UNIX to become session and process group
      leader. If that fails, fork, terminate the parent and execute setsid()
      in the child process. Use fork_helper() to start the UNIX cleanup helper
      in a child process and continue with the main application in the parent.
    - x2goclient.cpp: add myself to copyright header.
    - x2goclient.cpp: add legacy <sys/types.h> header needed for old operating
      systems.
    - x2goclient.cpp: fix std::edit -> std::exit typo.
    - unixhelper.{h,cpp}: also include <QtCore/qglobal.h> to have Q_OS_UNIX
      defined on UNIX-based platforms. Move guards around.
    - unixhelper.h: forgot to declare type of unix_cleanup() function.
    - {unixhelper.{cpp,h},x2goclient.cpp}: unixhelper should really be a
      (module) namespace, not a class.
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: add documentation/comments.
    - x2goclient.cpp: return return value of unixhelper::unix_cleanup().
    - unixhelper.cpp: kill process group on error.
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: implement signal unblocking in
      unixhelper::unix_cleanup(). Update documentation.
    - unixhelper.cpp: port from std::signal() to sigaction(). Handle errors.
    - x2goclient.cpp: clean up. We don't care if setsid() fails or succeeds
      and we certainly do not need to fork to force it to succeed. Whether we
      are a process group leader already or become one doesn't matter, if the
      end result is that we are process group leader.
    - x2goclient.cpp: don't start the UNIX cleanup helper process right after
      forking, but introduce a new command line option --unixhelper and
      re-execute the main binary with this new option to indicate that the
      UNIX cleanup helper tool is requested. It is necessary to call exec()
      after fork on virtually all operating system, especially on OS X.
    - x2goclient.cpp: fix compile problems introduced with the last commit.
    - x2goclient.cpp: fix string comparison.
    - x2goclient.cpp: create new argv array on the heap instead of on the
      stack. Stack data will be invalid once the function goes out of scope
      (which is what execv is doing.)
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: raise sleeping time to two seconds and grace period
      to 10 seconds.
    - {unixhelper.{cpp,h},x2goclient.cpp}: switch main cleanup handling to
      parent PID polling.
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: ignore SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGPIPE, SIGQUIT, SIGUSR1
      and SIGUSR2.
    - x2goclient.cpp: fix failing exec() call for the UNIX helper utility:
      correctly terminate arguments vector.
    - {appdialog,configwidget,onmainwindow,unixhelper}.cpp: fix some compile
      warnings with GCC. Fix a few whitespace issues.
    - appdialog.cpp: initialize parent in default case. Another GCC compile
      warning fix.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: correctly use ~/.x2go/.ssh as ssh directory when
      starting sshd in user mode. Put the authorized_keys file in there. Check
      and set correct permissions for both the directory and authorized_keys
      file. Generalize some Windows-specific sections by using QDir and QFile.
    - compat.{cpp,h}: new files. Implements strndup on OS X 10.6 and below.
      Add to x2goclient.cpp, x2goclient.pro and x2goclient.pro.maemo.
    - compat.{cpp,h}: remove inline keyword, because function is not defined
      in header file.
    - compat.h: include QtCore/qglobal.h for Q_OS_... macros.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: new class for PulseAudio management.
    - x2goclient.pro{,.maemo}: reference new pulsemanager.{cpp,h} files.
    - macbuild.sh: add new MACPORTS_PREFIX detection/variable.
    - macbuild.sh: add new dependency_error() helper function.
    - macbuild.sh: add new lazy_canonical_path() helper function.
    - macbuild.sh: add new get_nesting_level() helper function.
    - macbuild.sh: add new repeat_str() helper function.
    - macbuild.sh: refactor nxproxy detection to use MACPORTS_PREFIX.
    - macbuild.sh: add EXE_DIR and FRAMEWORKS_DIR internal variables. Create
      directories based on that. Use them when bundling.
    - macbuild.sh: define PulseAudio libraries and binaries to be later
      copied. Discover them using MACPORTS_PREFIX. Error out if any component
      was not found.
    - macbuild.sh: copy PulseAudio libraries and binaries.
    - macbuild.sh: add phase output for bundling nxproxy.
    - macbuild.sh: add work-in-progress PulseAudio bundling. Needs to be ripped
      apart and be redone, because dylibbundler is not smart enough to handle
      our case.
    - macbuild.sh: add Linux library file name scheme regex as a precaution.
    - macbuild.sh: directories are "executable", so the first check must
      explicitly include a check for the argument being not a directory.
    - macbuild.sh: add some more debugging output.
    - macbuild.sh: remove libpulse and libpulsecore from libraries to be
      bundled, as something else will bundle them anyway.
    - macbuild.sh: use while-read-loop and find to actually recurse through
      directories.
    - macbuild.sh: check current file name against regex, not a (now) full
      path.
    - macbuild.sh: add the correct file path to the library bundling array.
    - macbuild.sh: when actually bundling libraries, use @executable_path
      instead of @loader_path. Will need testing.
    - macbuild.sh: fix echo call to also show the intermediate lib dir, not
      just the library file name. Helps debugging.
    - macbuild.sh: also install libraries into staging area with intermediate
      library path. Putting everything into a single place is a stupid idea.
    - deduplicate.sh: add new, more or less Proof of Concept, and Work in
      Progress file deduplication script.
    - deduplicate.sh: add duplicates-to-real mapping.
    - deduplicate.sh: add missed local variable declaration.
    - deduplicate.sh: new function for parsing otool's output and printing
      library dependencies if no error occurred.
    - deduplicate.sh: non-functional: change WARNING to ERROR in error
      messages.
    - deduplicate.sh: add first skeleton for library dependency rewriting of
      deleted duplicates.
    - deduplicate.sh: correctly unset an array element.
    - deduplicate.sh: change range-based for loops to "${!arr[@]}" to handle
      "sparse" arrays correctly.
    - deduplicate.sh: quote "${arr[@]}" correctly to not suddenly force word
      splitting.
    - deduplicate.sh: fix parse_otool_output: we want to return failure only
      iff any of the strings are present in otool's output and actually handle
      the failure string *ARRAY* correctly as that.
    - deduplicate.sh: change exit to return in parse_otool_output.
    - deduplicate.sh: record crafted "library path" values in duplicates
      replacement to_files array.
    - deduplicate.sh: debug parse_otool_output fiercely for the time being.
    - deduplicate.sh: prevent word splitting when parsing otool's output. We
      want the raw bits.
    - deduplicate.sh: switch to range-based for loop in fixup section for
      duplicate array walking as we need to access the same element index in
      the replacement array.
    - deduplicate.sh: add more useful information in fixup section's error
      message.
    - deduplicate.sh: unstub fixup section.
    - deduplicate.sh: parse_otool_output: jump over first matching entry,
      which is - hopefully - the id line.
    - deduplicate.sh: actually include file name in install_name_tool pseudo
      output.
    - deduplicate.sh: save dependency format base string as a readonly
      variable and use that instead of repeating a fixed string.
    - deduplicate.sh: copy lazy_canonical_path from macbuild.sh for now.
      deduplicate.sh will eventually be merged into macbuild.sh anyway.
    - deduplicate.sh: more temporary debugging output in fixup section.
    - deduplicate.sh: surprisingly, it turned out that only checking the
      duplicate's basename against the current dependency's basename is not
      good enough. Actually construct "the real dependency-format duplicate
      string" and check it against "the real dependency". Even this is still
      not good enough as it needs a bit cleanup - coming up next.
    - deduplicate.sh: cleanup as announced in the last commit - using
      lazy_canonical_path.
    - deduplicate.sh: remove a bit of noisy debug output, but turn on
      parse_otool_output debugging.
    - deduplicate.sh: fix wrong return value capture. We want to check the
      return value of the executed function/command, not that of "typeset".
    - deduplicate.sh: add WARNING to status message.
    - deduplicate.sh: remove some noisy debug output.
    - macbuild.sh: replace tabs with two spaces. No functional changes.
    - deduplicate.sh: replace tabs with two spaces. No functional changes.
    - macbuild.sh: merge deduplicate.sh content in. Also enable the
      functionality "for real", not just as a dry-run.
    - macbuild.sh: spelling fix.
    - macbuild.sh: more more debug messages and a whitespace change.
    - macbuild.sh: fix removal of base prefix in deduplication if base prefix
      ends in a slash.
    - macbuild.sh: copy "special" files, so that they can be removed later on.
    - macbuild.sh: rewrite ID line detection algorithm. Modules don't seem to
      be needing one, so skipping the first dependency line incidentally skips
      a "real" dependency for modules.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: use name and underscore for member variables, not
      underscore and name.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: minor non-behavior changing fixes.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: reformat only.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: use initializer list for constructor.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: add pulse_version_{major,minor}_ member variables.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: reformat only.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: switch port definitions to std::uint16_t.
    - pulsemanager.h: add std:: namespace selector for uint32_t version
      variables.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: add ESD support.

  [ Bernard Cafarelli ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.3):
    - {res/,x2goclient.pro}: rename .rcc files to .qrc. Fixes: #1096. "rcc" is
      the extension for compiled resource files, whereas "qrc" is the mapping
      file. Qt5 stumbles upon that - i.e., it doesn't try to compile files
      with the "rcc" extension, while Qt4 did.
    - res/: fix up previous change, the renaming of changelog.qrc was not
      correctly committed.

  [ Jason Alavaliant ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.3):
    - src/{onmainwindow.{cpp,h},help.cpp}: modify autostart option to support
      multiple autostart apps at the same time. Fixes: #1024.

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.3):
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix SSHFS on Windows client. Fixes: #1105.

x2goclient (4.0.5.2-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Klaus Ade Johnstad ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.2):
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: update Bokmål (Norway) translation file.

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.2):
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: fixup translation by respecting the
      original messages' format, typo fixes and other changes.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_fi.ts: fixup translation by respecting the original
      messages' format and other changes.
    - src/{ongetpass,onmainwindow}.cpp: fixup QPlastiqueStyle usage on Qt5.
      This particular style has been removed/replaced by Fusion, which
      incorporates features of both Plastique and Clearlooks styles.
    - x2goclient.spec: whitespace only.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add (default) MacPorts prefix, /usr/local/bin and
      /opt/X11/bin to x2goclient's environment and child environments before
      starting xmodmap. Fixes: #1019. Requires a re-release of X2Go Client for
      OS X.
    - src/x2goutils.{cpp,h}: add new function add_to_path () to add multiple
      entries to a PATH-like string if they do not exist in there yet.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: replace old code to modify the PATH value with the
      new add_to_path () function.
    - src/{onmainwindow,sshmasterconnection}.cpp: refactoring and whitespace only
      changes following up the #1027 patch.
    - src/onmainwindow.h: add new enum for selecting SSH host key types.
    - src/onmainwindow.h: rename ONMainWindow::generateHostDsaKey () to
      ONMainWindow::generateHostKey () and make key type selectible. Fixes:
      #1003. Host key type selection currently only works within the code. Replace
      calls to former ONMainWindow::generateHostDsaKey () with the generalized
      function and request an RSA-type key.
    - src/help.cpp: actually make help descriptions translatable. Looks ugly
      and is cumbersome to use, but there seems to be no other way to do
      that...
    - src/help.h: typo fix in comment only.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add some comments related to maybe using
      add_to_path ().
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: work around changed SSH host key locations in OS X
      10.11+. Fixes: #1079. Also check /etc/ssh/ for keys.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix last commit by using QFileInfo instead of
      QDir. This lets us use the exists () member function correctly.
    - {nsis/x2goclient.nsi,res/i18n/x2goclient_{da,es,et,fi,nl,zh_tw}.ts}:
      replace left-overs of "X2go" with the correct "X2Go" spelling.
      This mostly touches obsolete strings and file names, that need to be
      cleaned, but it's still worthwhile to not have it show up when searching
      for the old string. Given that NTFS is normally case-insensitive,
      removing the files will still work.
  * debian/control:
    - Maintainer change in package: X2Go Developers <x2go-dev@lists.x2go.org>.
    - Uploaders: add myself. Also, force a rebuild due to the changed
      versioning.

    - Windows: Update PuTTY from 0.66 to 0.67, which fixes
      CVE-2016-2563.
    - Windows: Update bundled Win32 OpenSSL from 1.0.1q to 1.0.1t,
      which fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2016-01-28,

      string needs to be displayed to the user.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: add support for Mobile OTP tokens and
      references for the other token types. Fixes: #1036.

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]

x2goclient (4.0.5.1-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.1):
    - onmainwindow.cpp: include sshd PID file path option in quotes to support
      whitespaces within the var directory path on Windows. Add comment to
      revisit this later on non-Windows-platforms, too. Fixes: #916.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: do NOT reformat. Reverts most of the previous commit
      because it breaks code logic.
    - res/txt/packs: add adaptive method.
    - {macbuild.sh,x2goclient.pro}: pass MacPorts library and include path's
      to qmake. Due to the qt4-mac's changes, we do not automatically get
      these values automatically "appended" in a usable way anymore.
    - x2gosettings.cpp: let centralSettings () return false on Windows.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: be more precise in slotScDaemonError () regarding
      unknown and undefined errors.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: don't use a hardcoded path to xmodmap on OS X and
      handle errors more gracefully. Fixes: #487.
    - x2goclient.pro: fix typo --stdlib=... -> -stdlib=... Fixes: #973.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: add some more error handling for parsing the return
      value of x2golistsessions. As it turns out, it can happen that "invalid"
      strings are inserted in there, for instance by the perl interpreter
      itself. We need to skip over these, or the client crashes when splitting
      up the invalid lines.
    - macbuild.sh: add stdlib forcing. Should not be used unless you really
      know what you're doing. If you ponder using this, you probably don't.
    - res/resources.rcc: add Turkish translation file. Fixes: #987.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: use lowercase version of locale. Fixes: #953.
      Fixes loading up the nb_NO translation file, which is actually baked as
      nb_no into the binary.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: let challenge-auth-based login attempts
      fallback to normal password authentication if the initial
      challenge-auth-based attempt was unsuccessful.
    - sshmasterconnection.{cpp,h}: support variable number of
      challenge-auth-code-based prompts.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: don't check prompts for full string equality -
      a matching prefix is good enough. Amongst others, this fixes errors in
      conditions where the prompt does not contain a trailing whitespace, but
      X2Go Client expects one.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: add OATH TOTP prompt prefix. Fixes: #860.
    - res/i18n: refresh translation files again.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: replace "X-Serv..." with "X.Org Server"
      where applicable.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: correctly use "XQuartz" where necessary.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: whitespace only.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: fix up some "x2go" -> "X2Go" errors.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: mark translation strings needing some care
      ("x2go..." -> "X2Go...") as unfinished for later fixup.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: fix (meta data) typo introduced with last
      commit.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nl.ts: fixup translation by respecting the original
      messages' format and other changes.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_de.ts: fixup translation by respecting the original
      messages' format, fixing typos and general improvements.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_es.ts: fixup translation by respecting the original
      messages' format and other changes.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_sv.ts: fixup translation by respecting the original
      messages' format and other changes.
  * debian/control:
    - Change apache2-dev | libc6-dev build dependency back to apache2-dev
      only. Otherwise, apache2-dev is not installed at all, even though
      theoretically available. The initial reasoning for this dependency type,
      apache2-dev not being available on all Ubuntu/Debian platforms, is not
      true anymore.
    - Change apache2-dev build dependency yet again to apache2-dev |

  * New upstream release (4.0.5.1):
    - Windows: Update bundled Win32 OpenSSL from 1.0.1p to 1.0.1q,
      which fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-12-03.
    - Windows: Upgrade Cygwin components to latest versions as of
      2016-01-21, except for the Cygwin DLL which is still at 1.7.33
      in order to avoid breaking folder sharing and printer sharing
      due to 1.7.34's ACL/permissions changes.
      (authorized_keys file would often have mode 660 instead of 600)
      The latest components include most notably:
        + openssh 6.8p1-1-x2go1 -> 7.1p2-1-x2go1 (security update)
        + openssl 1.0.2d-1 -> 1.0.2e-1 (security update)
    - Windows: Update nxproxy from 3.5.0.31 to 3.5.0.32
    - Windows: Update Unicode NSIS from 2.46.5 to 2.50.0 Pre-release,
      which fixes the DLL hijacking security vuln (NSIS bug 1125.)
    - Windows: Update PuTTY from 0.64 to 0.66, which fixes
      CVE-2015-5309.
    - Windows: Remove libzip. libssh no longer uses it.

  [ Orion Poplawski ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.1):
    - ssh{process,masterconnection}.cpp: run bash as a login shell when
      invoking any command remotely. Fixes: #928. Because this opens the door
      for ~/.bash_logout and friend scripts to be executed, which may contain
      calls to ncurses' reset or clear, also set the TERM variable to dump to
      not have unexpected output on stderr at logout time.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: check correct variable for validity: public key
      instead of private key (again.) Fixes: #945.

  [ Klaus Ade Johnstad ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.1):
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: update Bokmål (Norway) translation file.

  [ Heinrich Schuchardt ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.1):
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: don't fetch invalid proxy socket. Fixes: #1000.
      From http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qabstractsocket.html#socketDescriptor:
      The socket descriptor is not available when QAbstractSocket is in
      UnconnectedState.
      So we have to connect to the proxy server first before retrieving the
      native socket.

  [ Daniel Lindgren ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.1):
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_sv.ts: update Swedish translation file.

x2goclient (4.0.5.0-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.0):
    - INSTALL: add more verbose instructions on how to build X2Go Client and
      friends.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: rename slotScDaemonOut() and slotScDaemonError()
      to slotScDaemonStdOut() and slotScDaemonStdErr(). I will need
      slotScDaemonError() later and the previous names were a bit of a
      misnomer.
    - x2goutils.{cpp,h}: add new show_RichText_Generic_MsgBox() main function
      designed to replace the show_RichText_WarningMsgBox() function.
    - x2goutils.{cpp,h}: make show_RichText_WarningMsgBox() use
      show_RichText_Generic_MsgBox ().
    - x2goutils.{cpp,h}: new show_RichText_ErrorMsgBox() function as a wrapper
      for show_RichText_Generic_MsgBox() with a critical icon.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: properly handle scdaemon errors with a message box
      and close the client.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: manipulate PATH and append /usr/lib/gnupg2/ to it when
      starting scdaemon. Fixes: #882.
    - x2goutils.h: add QMessageBox include, fixed compile error.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: fix typos leading to compile errors.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: add blocks to switch cases to fix a compile error.
      Also correctly append to informative_text on one occasion, instead of
      overwriting it.
    - x2goutils.cpp: correct typo to fix compile errors.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: drop a redundant variable and fix empty env check.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: add more newlines to scdaemon error output. Use
      trayQuit() method to really quit the client.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: add debugging output for new scdaemon PATH value.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: split up PATH value as printed in the error message
      box by a newline every 100 characters. Makes it look less ugly and fixes
      truncation issues.
    - sshprocess.cpp: export PATH variable when running commands. Otherwise,
      only the first one will respect the new PATH value.
    - sshprocess.cpp: wrap SSH command prelude and conclusion in double
      quotes.
    - sshprocess.cpp: wrap all remote commands with "bash" instead of the
      unspecific "sh".
    - onmainwindow.cpp: try to escape shell quotes correctly when using
      Kerberos/GSSApi when running the xmodmap keyboard sync command on OS X.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: also escape other shell quotes when using
      Kerberos/GSSApi.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: silence compiler warning by casting an int value to
      std::size_t.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: silence another compiler warning by not converting
      from string to int and back to string needlessly. Just use the string.
      No need for an OS X-specific variable anymore.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: fix compile error - use QString.toAscii () to get a
      valid C string representation for tr ().
    - onmainwindow.cpp: don't terminate if scdaemon exited with non-zero exit
      code.
    - sshprocess.cpp: don't use QProcess::start (QString). Qt is trying to be
      too smart and causes big trouble. Instead, use QProcess::start (QString,
      QStringList) and pass the arguments as a list. On Windows, Qt will
      automatically double quote the arguments and duplicate escaped double
      quotes or escape non-escaped double quotes. On UNIX-like platforms, each
      element of the list is passed as a unique argv element, so there's no
      need for quoting them (that's only a shell-internal thing to group
      arguments.)
    - sshprocess.cpp: add a bit more debugging - also print out the unmodified
      raw output of SSH commands.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: remove now-bogus double quote escaping.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: port QProcess::start () change.
    - sshprocess.cpp: whitespace/prettify only and a compile fix.
    - x2goclient.pro: reinstate old lrelease "search" behavior if
      qtPrepareTool() is not available. This should only happen on EPEL 6,
      which ships a broken Qt4 version...
    - onmainwindow.cpp: only set multidisplay mode for non-rootless sessions.
    - {ui/xsettingsui.ui,xsettingswidget.cpp}: add new "whole display" option
      for external X server configuration. Part of #883.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: rename "optionsmd" setting to "optionswholedisplay",
      which is more clear.
    - xsettingswidget.cpp: fix compile error: settings -> setting.
    - sessionmanagedialog.cpp: enable some debugging and make selected
      sessions configureable or deletable. Fixes: #909.

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * debian/control:
    + Add alternative D for nxproxy: qvd-nxproxy. Allows parallel installation
      of X2Go Client and the TheQVD client (perl-qvd-client).

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
    - Windows: Update bundled Win32 OpenSSL from 1.0.1m to 1.0.1p,
      which fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-06-11 and
      CVE-2015-1793 (announced on 2015-07-09).
    - Windows: Upgrade the MSVC 2008 DLLs (9.0.21022.8) to the
      MSVC 2013 DLLs (12.0.21005.1), which Win32 OpenSSL now requires.
    - Windows: Only bundle msvcr120.dll; The other 2 MSVC DLLs aren't
      needed by Win32 OpenSSL.
    - Windows: Update bundled Cygwin OpenSSL from 1.0.2a-1 to 1.0.2d-1, which
      which fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-06-11 and
      CVE-2015-1793 (announced on 2015-07-09).
    - Windows: Update bundled VcXsrv from 1.17.0.0-1 (X2Go/Arctica Build)
      to 1.17.0.0-3 (X2Go/Arctica Build)
      The differences relevant to X2Go are:
        + VcXsrv's bundled version of openssl was updated from 1.0.2a
          to 1.0.2d (fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-06-11 and
          CVE-2015-1793 (announced on 2015-07-09).
        + Drop winmultiwindow.patch (Part of #883)
        + hw/xwin/glx: Don't create fbConfigs for un-accelerated
          pixelFormats
          This has the effect of disabling StaticColor under
          MultiWindow mode with -wgl (default) and -swrastwgl, and
          thus making X2Go sessions started from the Windows client
          able to be resumed on the client on a different OS or the
          client runing on Windows with different display settings.
          (Fixes: #696)
    - Linux: Fix desktop session icons (.desktop files) failing due to
      missing space between "x2goclient" and its 1st argument
      (e.g. "--session") (Fixes: #911)

  [ Henning Heinold ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.0):
    - x2goclient.pro: simplify lrelease path preparing for different OS and
      cross compiling. Fixes: #901.

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.0):
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: fix multimonitor mode on Windows. Run VcXsrv on
      selected screen without decorations.

x2goclient (4.0.4.0-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.4.0):
    - Windows: Do not delete saved PuTTY sessions when Kerberos 5
      (GSSAPI) authentication is enabled (Fixes: #625/#789)
    - Windows: Fix "Connection failed" "pscp" error with folder
      sharing when Kerberos 5 (GSSAPI) auth is used, and the
      server-side home dir is at a path other than /home/$USER
      (Fixes: #868)
    - Windows: Fix audio (PulseAudio) when Kerberos 5
      (GSSAPI) authentication is used (Fixes: #869)
    - Windows: Include debug build in the regular installer.
      It is an optional component during the install. It is not
      installed by default.
    - Windows: Include Pageant and PuTTYgen in the installer.
      They are optional components during the install. They are
      installed by default.
    - Windows: Add descriptions for the "components" in the installer
      (English language only at this time)
    - Windows: You can now view the version and some other info by:
      right-click on the installer -> Properties -> Details
      (English language only at this time)
    - Windows: Upgrade bundled PulseAudio from 5.0-rev18 to 6.0-11.1
      (No known impacts to X2Go, except for the fact that many needed
       patches are now included in upstream PulseAudio.)
    - Windows: Upgrade bundled VcXsrv from 1.15.2.2-xp+vc2013+x2go1 to
      1.17.0.0-1 (X2Go/Arctica Build)
      Note that X2Go Client for Windows 4.0.3.2-20150508 has an
      update to 1.15.2.6 (X2Go/Arctica), which fixes all the CVEs.
      The differences relevant to X2Go are:
        + Numerous X.org components were upgraded to new major/minor
          versions.
        + CVE-2015-0255 was fixed in VcXsrv itself
        + CVE-2015-3418 was fixed in VcXsrv itself

          to 1.5.1 (Fixes CVE-2015-1802 through CVE-2015-1804)
        + VcXsrv's bundled version of freetype was updated from 2.5.3
          to 2.5.5 (fixes CVE-2014-9656 through CVE-2014-9675)
    - Windows: Update bundled Win32 OpenSSL from 1.0.1L to 1.0.1m,
      which fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-03-19.
      Note that X2Go Client for Windows 4.0.3.2-20150329 has this update
      also.
    - Windows: Update bundled PuTTY from 0.63 to 0.64.
      In addition to other changes, CVE-2015-2157 has been fixed.
    - Windows: Upgrade libssh from 0.6.4 to 0.7.0 (while maintaining
      Pageant support).
      The differences relevant to X2Go are:
        + CVE-2015-3146 was fixed
        + Added support for ed25519 keys
        + Added SHA2 algorithms for HMAC
      Note that X2Go Client for Windows 4.0.3.2-20150508 has the update
      to 0.6.5, which fixes the CVE also.
    - Windows: Update bundled nxproxy (nx-libs-lite) from 3.5.0.27 to
      3.5.0.31. (bugfix & feature update)
    - Windows: Update/Upgrade bundled Cygwin components to latest
      versions as of 2015-04-25 (except for the Cygwin DLL, which was
      upgraded but not to the latest version).
      Note that all the security fixes were included in updates to
      X2Go Client for Windows 4.0.3.2
        + openssl 1.0.1k-1 -> 1.0.2a-1 (upgrade. includes security fixes
          for the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-03-19.)
        + libjpeg-turbo 1.8.1-1 -> 1.8.1-3 (security update for
          CVE-2014-9092)
        + libpng 1.5.21-2 -> libpng16 1.6.17-1 (upgrade, may improve X2Go
          performance when PNG compression is selected. Also includes the
          fix for CVE-2013-6954)
        + gcc 4.8.3-3 -> 4.9.2-3 (upgrade, may improve X2Go performance a
          little bit)
        + openssh 6.6p1-3-x2go1 -> 6.8p1-1-x2go1 (upgrade, probably not
          relevant to X2Go)
        + cygwin (DLL) 1.7.32-1 -> 1.7.33-1 (upgrade, probably not
          relevant to X2Go)
        + dash 0.5.8-2 -> 0.5.8-3 (feature update, not relevant to X2Go)
        + ncurses 5.9-20140524-1 -> 5.9-20150404-1 (update, probably
          not relevant to X2Go)
        + zlib 1.2.8-1 -> 1.2.8-3 (update, undocumented by Cygwin project)
    - Windows: Copy the exact version of each cygwin DLL from the cygwin
      binary tarballs rather than copying the "rebased" version from
      an X2Go developer's cygwin installation.
      What effect this will have on users is TBD. However, it does mean
      that we are distributing the exact DLLs that the Cygwin project
      provides, which is desirable for security.

    - Use the correct client build dir in macbuild.sh: client_build.
    - Only use --stdlib compiler flag on 10.7+. Unsupported on 10.6 and below.
    - Use sh default assignment instead of default value in macbuild.sh.
      Removes the need to redundantly specify the variable name.
    - App bundle and dmg file will be automatically removed when removing the
      client build directory. Remove redundancy from macbuild.sh.
    - Remove 'function' keyword in macbuild.sh, as it's causing undefined
      behavior according to SUS.
    - Define and implement new function 'make_boolean()' in macbuild.sh. Takes
      a pseudo-boolean value and outputs either 0 or 1. Use this function.
    - Move functions to the start of the macbuild.sh script.
    - New env var/parameter UNIVERSAL in macbuild.sh. Switches the build
      architecture to either exclusively x86_64 (UNIVERSAL=0) or both x86_64

    - x2goclient.spec: fix builds on Fedora and related due to failing removal
      of browserplugin directory. That's non-critical.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: actually call slotTunnelOk(int), do not generate a run
      time error by calling the non-existent function slotTunnelOk().
      Fixes: #804.

      links. Add MacPorts reference.
    - configdialog.cpp: reformat code, add MacPorts and XQuartz references,
      URL's and installation instructions, don't show outdated version warning
      when no XQuartz server is installed. Fixes: #792.
    - x2goutils.{h,cpp}: use QString references.
    - x2goutils.{h,cpp}: add new helper function show_RichText_WarningMsgBox.
    - configdialog.cpp: use new helper function show_RichText_WarningMsgBox to

    - x2goclient.pro{,.maemo}: add new help.{cpp,h} files.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: replace old help system with new one.
    - {{onmainwindow,help}.cpp},help.h}: fix misc. build errors.

      write to.
    - help.cpp: clear current string if completely written onto one line.
    - help.cpp: enable debugging for pretty_print(). --debug must be supplied
      before --help for this to work.
    - help.cpp: fix splitting algorithm to step over a space character, but
      include hyphens correctly into the current line.
    - help.cpp: don't let qCritical() add even more spaces or quotes around
      the help message.
    - help.cpp: add support for newlines within descriptions.
    - help.cpp: use new newline feature for some options.
    - help.cpp: trying to split at hyphens was a bad idea. Remove that part.

      (caused by a typo) on Windows.
    - help.cpp: hardcode indentation value to 2 (for the first spaces) +
      maximum length of parameters + 4 (for the trailing 4 spaces).
      Calculations via terminal_cols and remaining do not work, if
      terminal_cols is unknown.
    - x2goutils.{cpp,h}: implement new git_changelog_extract_commit_sha
      helper, extracting the most recent commit shasum from a git changelog
      string.

      building the help prelude.
    - helpdialog.cpp: change to monospaced font.
    - helpdialog.cpp: use QT_VERSION macro to select either a monospaced or

    - x2goutils.{cpp,h}: add new font_is_monospaced() helper.
    - helpdialog.cpp: try harder to set a monospaced font.
    - helpdialog.cpp: lower font size to have more space for text.
    - ui/helpdialog.ui: almost double the window size.
    - help.cpp: typo fix for --git-info.
    - help.{cpp,h}: provide string splitting logic as separate
      split_long_line() function. Use this in pretty_print().
    - help.cpp: simplify pretty_print() and make it also split lines for
      non-terminal output or when the terminal width is unknown.
    - help.{cpp,h}: add a boolean terminal_output parameter to the
      pretty_print() function family. Controls terminal width auto-detection
      and automatic printing to stderr.

      PULSE_CLIENTCONFIG setting once more.
    - {macbuild,res/osxbundle/postbuild}.sh: add support for git information
      if not building from a tag. Also includes build date.
    - {{configdialog,onmainwindow}.cpp,x2goutils.{cpp,h}}: new helper
      functions show_XQuartz_not_found_error(), show_XQuartz_start_error() and
      show_XQuartz_generic_error(). The first two are calling the latter one.
      Replace previous messages in configdialog.cpp and onmainwindow.cpp with
      the helpers, because they are supposed to pop up a dialog showing almost
      the same message.
    - x2goutils.cpp: fix compile error. tr () is a member of QObject and must
      be explicitly marked as such in a free function.
    - {configdialog.{cpp,h},onmainwindow.cpp}: miscellaneous typo fixes - no
      functional changes.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: whitespace changes to installTranslator() only.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: correctly let Qt fetch the UI display language for Qt
      4.8.0 and higher. The old "compat" behavior is retained for older
      versions of Qt, which do not have the semantics of a UI display
      language. Fixes: #845.
    - config_win.bat: enable release by default, fetch command line parameter
      and compare against debug. Enable debug and console features in that
      case.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: follow-up to last translation fix. Actually handle
      English locales correctly and don't duplicate code too much.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: make new get_translator() function static. Correct
      typo in implementation.
    - onmainwindow.h: include used types/headers.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: correctly call QLocale::uiLanguages ().
    - onmainwindow.cpp: copy strings before manipulating them.
    - onmainwindow.h: make get_translator() const. Does not change any state.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: fix compile error triggered by a missing
      parenthesis/typo.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: workaround https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-25973.
    - onmainwindow.h: revert const-qualifier for get_translator(). It's static
      and can't have any cv-qualifier.
    - copy-deps-win32.bat: actually let xcopy error correctly.
    - general: improve debug output and error messages.

x2goclient (4.0.3.2-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Fix placement of session folders in session card column. (Fixes: #681).
    - Send empty message in x2gohelper to stop AppStarting cursor. (Fixes: #616).
    - Fix multiple creations of modmap timer (OS_DARWIN).

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Add several info/error/debug log message while hunting down #702.
    - Use app.setQuitOnLastWindowClosed(false) for the X2Go Client QtApplication
      to assure that X2Go Client does not arbitrarily exit during a running
      session. This fixes X2Go Client crashes that occur when printing via
      the CUPS-X2Go printing mechanism with activate print dialog popup on
      incoming print jobs and minimized main window. (Fixes: #702).
    - Be more exact when reporting rev forwarding tunnel request failures to
      the GUI user. Include the purpose of the tunnel (NX, audio, foldersharing)
      in the error message.
    - Enable debugging in sshprocess.cpp and sshmasterconnection.cpp if
      --debug is given.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: Fix several grammar issues in error messages.
    - When sharing a client-side folder, do not write the SSH pub key to
      client-side authorized_keys file if the folder-to-be-shared does not
      exist on the client. (Partially solves #405).
    - Fix string concatenation/layout of error message when tunnel I/O errors
      occur.
    - Improve debugging/logging the SSH connections made by X2Go Client.
    - Fix quotes when calling remote commands via SSH (esp. allow same quoting/
      escaping style for libssh and openSSH+Krb based connections). (Fixes: #720).
    - FIXME: Disable PubkeyAuthentication _and_ PasswordAuthentication if
      GSSAPI authentication is activated. This is counter intuitive, though,
      and requires several other fixes in the authentication code.
  * x2goclient.spec:
    - Always set BuildRoot: parameter.

  [ Sergey Savko ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Prevent passwordless re-logins into X2Go Session Broker if
      --broker-autologoff is used on the cmdline. (Fixes: #782).
    - Add new cmdline option --broker-noauth-use-session-username.
      When --broker-noauth is used, the broker does not know on behalf
      of which user to operate. This new option enables username syncing.
      When logging into X2Go Server, that username will be sent to the
      broker and be used for querying X2Go Broker Agents etc. (Fixes: #781).

  [ Heinrich Schuchardt ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Base the layout dialogue "Session ID" (which shows up when starting a
      connection) on typographic points (instead of pixels). (Fixes: #713).

  [ Jason Alavaliant ]
  * New upstream verson (4.0.3.2):
    - Use QUrl::toPercentEncoding() method to properly encode passwords sent
      to X2Go Session Broker. (Fixes: #705).

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Windows: Win32 OpenSSL updates from 1.0.1j to 1.0.1L, which
      fixes the CVEs announced on 2015-01-08.
    - Windows: Cygwin OpenSSL updated from 1.0.1j-1 to 1.0.1k-1, which
      fixes the CVEs announced on 2015-01-08.
    - Windows: Bundle new version of VcXsrv: 1.15.2.2-xp+vc2013+x2go1.
      The differences from 1.15.2.1-xp+vc2013+x2go1 are that its bundled
      OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.1k, and that xorg-server
      CVE-2014-8091..8103 have been fixed.
    - Windows: Update libssh from 0.6.3 to 0.6.4 (while maintaining
      Pageant support). This fixes CVE-2014-8132, which shouldn't
      affect x2goclient because x2goclient uses the SSH client
      functionality, not the SSH server functionality.
      0.6.4 also added 4 features related to ECDSA keys.
    - Windows: Fix compatibility with PulseAudio 6.0
    - Windows: Remove workaround for audio input with old versions of
      PulseAudio (calling parec once per second)
      (Fixes: #742)
      Thanks George Trakatelis (uom.edu.gr) for submitting this change.
    - Windows: Enable X2Go Client for Windows to build under VS2010 nmake
      (but not the VS2010 IDE due to a Qt4 Visual Studio Add-in limitation)
      Note that the official builds are still build under MinGW.
      (Fixes: #642)
      Thanks George Trakatelis (uom.edu.gr) for submitting this feature.
    - Windows: Make builds easier, and updating bundled dependencies
      easier, by adding copy-deps-win32.bat. It copies the exact
      version of each dependency (DLL, executable, data, folder, etc)
      from x2goclient-contrib.git.

x2goclient (4.0.3.1-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.1):

      documented so far.
    - Make sound options configurable via X2Go Session Broker. (Fixes: #652).
    - Fix (cross-user) desktop sharing since introduction of clipboard mode
      feature.
    - Update several translation files after splitting of session profile's
      "Settings" tab into "Input/Output" and "Media". Translations for these
      two new tabs derived from the i18n files of PyHoca-GUI.

x2goclient (4.0.3.0-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.0):
    - Disallow server-side users to override X2Go Server commands via
      ~/bin (or similar). (Fixes: #336).
    - Avoid unitialised variables on early calls of ONMainWindow::closeEvent()
      or ONMainWindow::closeClient(). (Fixes: #253).
    - Update translation files. Add empty Portuguese translation. Update
      qt_<lang>.qm files from Debian unstable as of today.
    - Update German translation file (after session folder feature got added).
    - Makefile.man2html: Test if man2html exists. If not, don't fail.
    - Honor exports (client-side shared folders) from broker session profiles.
      Thanks to Ming Song for providing a patch for this (Fixes: 612).
  * debian/control:
    + Add B-D: apache2-dev. On squeeze / lucid builds, this is a superfluous
      B-D, but for later Debian/Ubuntu versions, this smoothes the installation
      of the x2goplugin-provide bin:package.
    + Update B-D: apache2-dev | libc6-dev. The apache2-dev package does not
      exist on all Debian/Ubuntu versions.
  * x2goclient.spec:
    + Adapt to building for openSUSE/SLES.
    + openSUSE: Make Qt4 Linguist tools available for Makefile.
    + Upgrade versioned BR for libssh-devel (0.6.3 or patched 0.5.5).
    + The libqt4-linguist split off happened in openSUSE 13.1.
    + Add x2goclient-rpmlintrc file.
    + In openSUSE, it is openldap2-devel, in Fedora/RHEL it is openldap-devel.
    + In openSUSE, openssh is openssh (not openssh-clients / openssh-server).

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.0):
    - Fix running x2goclient without arguments on Windows. (Fixes: #522).
    - Save proxy output in $HOME/S-$SESSION-ID/session.log if debugging is
      enabled.
    - Fork x2goclient on windows and terminate child processes if X2Go Client
      crashed. (Fixes: #159).
    - Add "clipboard" parameter to session profile and to command line options.
      (Fixes: #258).
    - Replace qCritical() with printError() by argument parsing.
    - Update translation files.
    - Update russian translation.
    - Update string "&Clipboard Mode" and translate in russian translation file.
    - Grammar fix in russian translation.
    - Add x2gohelper to start X2Go Client on Windows and clean child processes
      if X2Go Client crashes. (Fixes: #525).
    - On Windows rename x2goclient.exe to x2goclient-mainprocess.exe and
      x2gohelper.exe to x2goclient.exe.
    - Start x2gohelper from X2Go Client. Revert name changing of X2Go Client and
      x2gohelper.
    - Add Makefile for x2gohelper.
    - Add support for sessions folders.
    - Add folder explorer: a GUI to manage of session subfolders.
    - Support for sessions subfolders in sessionmanagedialog.
    - Session name autocompletion only for sessions in current folder.
    - Support for session subfolders and command-line options "--session"
      and "--sessionid".
    - Disable session explorer "back" button if user sessions are disabled.
    - Include <QDir> in sessionexplorer.cpp.
    - Remove deprecated workaround in wapi.cpp.
    - Save folder icons Base64 coded. Save icons under General\icon_<PATH>.
      (Fixes: #580).
    - Fix placing sessions folders in broker mode.
    - Fix onmainwindow.cpp after 76ae96781f1d2d5754ee4751539d5de47f1d0297.
    - Add support for session selection in broker mode.

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.0):
    - Make X2Go Client aware of the Cinnamon (CINNAMON) desktop environment.
      (Fixes: #571)
    - Make X2Go Client aware of the Trinity (TRINITY) desktop environment.
      (Fixes: #609)
    - Make X2Go Client aware of the Openbox (OPENBOX) window manager.
      (Fixes: #607)
    - Make X2Go Client aware of the IceWM (ICEWM) window manager.
      (Fixes: #608)
    - Windows: Fix not being able to add the server to the known_hosts file when
      the username has non-English characters. (Fixes: #566)
      (NOTE: This fix only works when the non-English characters are in the same
      language as the Windows "system locale" AKA "Language for non-Unicode
      programs." Bug #611 was written for fixing the issue for languages other
      than the system locale.)
      Thanks George Trakatelis (uom.edu.gr) for submitting part of this fix.
    - Windows: Install VcXsrv "misc" fonts by default, and make all 4 font
      groups optional: misc, 75dpi, 100dpi and others (Fixes: #108)
      Note: The fact that all the fonts are included makes the installer about
      30MB larger.
    - Windows: Bundle new version of VcXsrv: 1.15.2.1-xp+vc2013+x2go1
      This new version is based on upstream VcXsrv 1.15.2.0, but still
      compatible with Windows XP. It also has its bundled OpenSSL updated to
      1.0.1j. It is compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 and contains 1
      X2Go-specific change, winmultiwindow.patch. This patch fixes an issue
      when resizing the NX-proxy window on specific multiple monitor setups.
      (Thanks Oleksandr Shneyder for the patch) (Fixes: #568) (Fixes: #594)
    - Windows: Port from MinGW 4.4 + Qt 4.8.5 to MinGW 4.8.2 + Qt 4.8.6,
      including fix for QTBUG-38706 (Fixes: #474, #603)
    - Windows: Fix missing VcXsrv/zlib1.dll . The impact of this bug was that
      VcXsrv would not start if the cwd was changed from the x2goclient
      directory. (The start menu and desktop shortcuts do have the x2goclient
      directory as the cwd. So they were not affected.) (Fixes: #587)
    - Windows: Make the desktop shortcut optional during install,
      but still the default.
    - Windows: Upgrade libssh from 0.5.5 to 0.6.3. This fixes connecting to
      hpn-enabled SSH servers. The Pageant support patch from the KDE Windows
      project was ported to 0.6.3 by myself and Mike Frederick.
      (Gmail: psududemike) (Fixes: #590)
    - Windows: Win32 OpenSSL updated from 1.0.1h to 1.0.1j, which fixes the
      CVEs announced on 2014-08-06 & 2014-10-15.
    - Windows: Replace Cygwin Bash (sh.exe) with Cygwin Dash (ash.exe renamed
      to sh.exe). This also means fewer Cygwin .DLLs are bundled.
      (Fixes: #636)
    - Windows: cygwin packages (excluding OpenSSH, which is at the patched
      version of 6.6.1p1-3-x2go1) updated from latest versions as of 2014-06-09
      to latest versions as of 2014-10-18. This includes openssl 1.0.1j-1, which
      fixes the CVEs announced on 2014-08-06 & 2014-10.15.
      (Cygwin openssl was also individually updated in 4.0.2.1+hotfix1+build2,
      but only to 1.0.1i-1.)
    - Windows: Build nxproxy.exe with Cygwin's libpng 1.5.x rather than 1.2.x.
      (This may improve performance when PNG compression is selected.)
    - Windows: Build cygwin openssh without krb5 or tcp_wrappers support because
      X2Go Client for Windows does not use either feature.
      (On Windows, Kerberos 5 (GSSAPI) support is provided by PuTTY.)
    - Windows: Fix text not being rendered properly at end of NSIS installer
      (Fixes: #597)

    - Only show session name in notification bubbles with debugging
      enabled. (Fixes: #364).
    - New command line option (--keep-trayicon). With that options set,
      we force X2Go client to only use the default "accelerated X" as
      system tray icon (and prohibit usage of the session's icon as
      tray icon). (Fixes: #365).
    - Provide more meaningful messages on SSH errors (host pub key not
      found, export pub key not found, authorized_keys file not found).

      and non-Windows machines. (Fixes: #235).
      FIXME: add detection code to report SSH daemon startup failures.
    - Add new cmdline option --hide-foldersharing. If used, all GUI
      elements related to exporting client-side folders to X2Go sessions
      get hidden. (Fixes: #514).
    - Update COPYING file (to update FSF address).
  * debian/control:
    + Add dbg:package x2goplugin-dbg.

      that requires pulse support.
    - Check if sound is activated before starting pulse.
    - Fix starting sshd on Win XP. (Fixes: #421).
    - Fix "fullscreen" mode on Windows 7 with multiple monitors.

    - Windows: Enable PulseAudio log when --debug is passed.
    - Windows: Fix compatibility with current PulseAudio master branch
    - Windows: cygwin packages (inluding patched OpenSSH 6.6.1p1-3) updated from
      latest versions as of 2014-04-08 to latest versions as of 2014-06-09. This
      includes openssl 1.0.1h-1, which fixes the 6 CVEs announced on 2014-06-05.
      (Cygwin openssl was also individually updated to 1.0.1h-1 in
      4.0.2.0+build4.) This also includes migrating from libjpeg to
      libjpeg-turbo, which reduces CPU usage of nxproxy.)
    - Windows: Download and compile nx-libs-lite from the release tarball,
      rather than from git, so that the patches are actually applied
    - Windows: nx-libs-lite updated from 3.5.0.22 to 3.5.0.27
      (linked against aforementioned cygwin package versions)
    - Windows: Win32 OpenSSL updated from 1.0.1g to 1.0.1h, which fixes the 6
      CVEs announced on 2014-06-05.

    - Windows: VcXsrv (XP Compatible) updated from 1.14.3.1 to 1.14.3.2.
      Fixes CVE-2014-0209, CVE-2014-0210, and CVE-2014-0211
      (VcXsrv was also updated to 1.14.3.2 in 4.0.2.0+build2.)
    - Windows: Switch from regular NSIS 2.46 to Unicode NSIS 2.46.5
      (Fixes: #528)
