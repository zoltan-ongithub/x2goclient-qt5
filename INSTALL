Requirements
==================

Before use this program you need to install:

Qt4:
http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/

nxcomp + nxproxy:
http://code.x2go.org/releases/source/nx-libs/

You may want also install the PulseAudio sound server and client to enable sound support
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Download/


Building
==================

Edit the Makefile to suit your needs.

Variables that may need modifications are:
  - QMAKE_BINARY
  - LRELEASE_BINARY

Variables that are being used by the install targets called later and might
need modifications are:
  - PREFIX
  - ETCDIR

Everything else should be left as-is.

------------------

On Linux-based systems, run:

make all

to build both X2Go Client and X2Go Plugin

or

make build_client

to build X2Go Client only

or

make build_plugin

to build X2Go Plugin only.


Installing
==================

On Linux-based systems, run:

make install

to install X2Go Client, X2Go Plugin, man pages and the plugin provider.

Alternatively, use one of the targets:
  - install_client: for X2Go Client only
  - install_plugin: for X2Go Plugin only
  - install_man: for the man pages only
  - install_pluginprovider: for the plugin provider only


Uninstalling
==================

On Linux-based systems, use the same procedure as lined out in the "Installing"
section, but replace "install" with "uninstall".
